        In this experiment, you will be asked to evaluate footage of people having a conversation. A visualization of a speaker's acoustic environment may be employed. The study will be broken into two parts:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Rating task</b>: You will be asked to rate a particular speaker's emotional state among a number of dimensions.</li>
            <li><b>Environment task</b>: You will be asked to determine what environment the speaker is situated in based off audio visualizations.</li>
        
        </ul>
        At the end of each stage, you will be prompted to <b>download your data</b>. Your data will be a small text file (.json). At the conclusion of the study, you will be given a google form to upload your data.
        <p></p>
        Audio is a cruicial component of this study, so please make sure you have <b>headphones</b> or <b>speakers</b> enabled.
