        <h2>The End</h2>
        <p></p>
        You've reached the end of the experiment! Good job! That must've been tough going through all those videos, especially with all the repetition! You really deserve a pat on the back. It's thanks to the blood sweat and tears of people like you that empirical studies can happen. When I take a step back, and look at all the people who participate in experiments, all I can say is "WOW" and "hat's off!"
        <p></p>
        You don't need to do anything else. There are no more trials. You may now close the window, and get on with the rest of your life.
