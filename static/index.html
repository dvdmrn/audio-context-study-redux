        In this experiment, you will be asked to evaluate footage of people having a conversation. A visualization of a speaker's acoustic environment may be employed. The study will be broken into three parts:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Rating task</b>: You will be asked to rate a particular speaker's emotional state among a number of dimensions.</li>
            <li><b>Environment task</b>: You will be asked to determine what environment the speaker is situated in based off audio visualizations.</li>
	    <li><b>Feedback</b>: You will be given the option to provide quick qualitative feedback about your experience with this system.</li>        
        </ul>
        <p></p>
